# Vulnerability Management with OpenVAS on Azure

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the setup and utilization of an OpenVAS vulnerability management scanner within a secure Azure environment. It encompasses the creation of both a scanner and a vulnerable client virtual machine (VM), the execution of unauthenticated and credentialed scans, and the subsequent remediation and verification of identified vulnerabilities.

## Introduction and Objective

The objective was to create a practical vulnerability management lab using Azure. The setup involved deploying an OpenVAS VM to act as a vulnerability scanner and configuring a Windows 11 VM to be intentionally vulnerable. This controlled environment allowed for the assessment of security vulnerabilities and the implementation of remediation measures.

## Environment Setup

### Vulnerability Management Scanner

An OpenVAS VM was deployed from the Azure Marketplace with a preset configuration to facilitate vulnerability management. The VM was set up within a dedicated resource group named `Vulnerability-Management`, using the East US 2 region and a designated VNet. The initial configuration included disabling unnecessary monitoring features to streamline the setup. Post-deployment, the VM was accessed via SSH to complete the OpenVAS installation.

### Client Virtual Machine

A Windows 11 VM, named `Win11-Vulnerable`, was created in the same resource group and VNet as the OpenVAS VM. This ensured seamless network communication between the scanner and the target. The VM was configured with outdated software versions, including Firefox, VLC Player, and Adobe Reader, to simulate real-world vulnerabilities. Additionally, security measures such as the Windows Firewall were disabled to enhance the vulnerability profile.

## Vulnerability Scanning

### Unauthenticated Scan

Initially, an unauthenticated scan was performed using OpenVAS. The private IP address of the vulnerable VM was added as a target, and a new scan task was created. This scan provided a baseline assessment of the vulnerabilities present in the system without any credentialed access. The results highlighted general vulnerabilities but lacked depth due to the absence of system-level access.

### Credentialed Scan

To gain a comprehensive view of the vulnerabilities, a credentialed scan was configured. This involved enabling necessary services and registry settings on the Windows 11 VM to facilitate deeper inspection. Credentials were securely stored within OpenVAS, and a new scan target was created to include these credentials. The credentialed scan revealed more critical vulnerabilities, including those related to outdated software versions and misconfigurations.

## Remediation and Verification

Following the identification of vulnerabilities, remediation steps were undertaken. The outdated software applications were uninstalled from the Windows 11 VM, and the system was restarted to ensure changes took effect. A subsequent credentialed scan was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the remediation efforts. The results confirmed a significant reduction in detected vulnerabilities, validating the applied fixes.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrated the process of setting up a vulnerability management environment in Azure, performing both unauthenticated and credentialed scans, and implementing effective remediation strategies. The use of OpenVAS as a vulnerability scanner, coupled with a controlled lab environment, provided valuable insights into the identification and resolution of security vulnerabilities.

By replicating real-world scenarios with outdated software and disabled security controls, the project highlighted the importance of regular vulnerability assessments and prompt remediation to maintain a secure infrastructure.
